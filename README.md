## 🧩 Project Case Studies

<div align="center">

### 🏕️ Supply Post (E-Commerce Site)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZzX6ziq.png" alt="Supply Post" width="400px">

<p align="center">
<b>Problem:</b> The objective of the Supply Post E-Commerce website was to create a clean and organized storefront where users can shop for their favorite outdoor gear. The project brief was to create the website for the company, including logo and everything. The reason behind it was to provide a cohesive high quality website for an ecommerce website.
</p>

<p align="center">
<b>Process:</b> I was the one maintaining github control, version control, as well as creating the landing page./ home page for the website. I was a key component for making the landing page become accessible and functional for all the other web pages on the site as well.
</p>

<p align="center">
<b>Results:</b> The outcome of the work was complicated. Due to the time restraints, and being the last in the chain to receive deliverables from previous teams, it was difficult creating a final product. While we have done everything in order to facilitate the incoming material easily, it was clear that we simply did not have enough material to work off of. I believe that we were able to create something that is still professional, accessible and creative.

<p align="center">
<b>Problem:</b> The objective of the Simplitax project was to create a simple and interactive web-based calculator for generating receipts. The project brief was to create something from scratch that used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript effectively to show my ability to make something both functional and visually appealing.
</p>

<p align="center">
<b>Process:</b> I started by laying out the HTML structure to contain all the main elements like input fields, receipt display area, and button controls. Once that was done I moved to the CSS to make it look the part, I wanted it to look like a printed receipt on a wooden table. I added textures for the paper and wood backgrounds to give it a realistic feel. After that I wrote the JavaScript logic to handle adding items, calculating the tax, and dynamically generating the receipt as the user adds more data.
</p>

<p align="center">
<b>Results:</b> The outcome was a completely functional and polished receipt generator that runs directly in the browser. It calculates and displays all added items accurately including their sales tax, and presents them in a nicely formatted way. The work was completed and shows a clean example of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsukidan/myswitchlifedashboard/main/public/img/gamelibrary.png" alt="MySwitchLife Game Library" width="400px">

<p align="center">
<b>Problem:</b> The objective of the MySwitchLife project was to create a personal dashboard for Nintendo Switch users where they can see their games, goals, activity, and friends all in one place. The project brief was to make a full stack website from scratch that looks like a Nintendo styled UI and actually works end to end. The reason behind it was to provide a clean organized way to track play history and organize a game library instead of random spreadsheets or notes.
</p>

<p align="center">
<b>Process:</b> I started with the server using Node.js and Express, connected to MongoDB, and set up a collection called library for saving games. I implemented routes for the library like GET and POST and DELETE on /api/games so users can load, save, and remove entries. For game data I added a Twitch OAuth flow to fetch an access token and then used the IGDB API to pull Nintendo Switch titles using a custom query that filters by platform 130. On the front end I built pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that include the dashboard, goals, and friend feed.
</p>

<p align="center">
<b>Results:</b> The outcome was a working full stack web dashboard that feels like a real app. It pulls curated Nintendo game data from IGDB using a server proxy, saves a personal library into MongoDB, and manages per game goals that can be added, edited, checked off, or removed. The dashboard loads recent activity automatically and showcases a clean responsive interface.
