The objective of the Supply Post E-Commerce website was to create a clean and organized storefront where users can shop for their favorite outdoor gear. The project brief was to create the website for the company, including logo and everything. The reason behind it was to provide a cohesive high quality website for an ecommerce website.

I was the one maintaining github control, version control, as well as creating the landing page./ home page for the website. I was a key component for making the landing page become accessible and functional for all the other web pages on the site as well. I was able to begin by looking at what I did in the past, looking at what I learned and what I could take from it as well as understanding that a website is different from a c++ program, and translating the successes accordingly. In addition to that, we had a team for the UX so I decided to work on the back-end codebase as the web development team member. With all of this in mind, I was able to incorporate the front-end design fairly quickly due to my focus on the back-end and version control being maintained while awaiting deliverables from the UX-Team.

<p align="center">
The objective of the Simplitax project was to create a simple and interactive web-based calculator for generating receipts. The project brief was to create something from scratch that used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript effectively to show my ability to make something both functional and visually appealing. The reason behind it was to provide a demonstration of web development fundamentals while creating something actually usable for users who want to calculate totals and sales tax in real time.
</p>

<img alt="Subsection" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Results-398bca?style=for-the-badge&logoColor=white"><br>
<p align="center">
The outcome was a completely functional and polished receipt generator that runs directly in the browser. It calculates and displays all added items accurately including their sales tax, and presents them in a nicely formatted way. The work was completed and shows a clean example of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration. While it was not made for a client, it represents my ability to deliver front-end work that is both practical and styled professionally. The project can be viewed in full on my personal portfolio or GitHub page.

<p align="center">
The objective of the MySwitchLife project was to create a personal dashboard for Nintendo Switch users where they can see their games, goals, activity, and friends all in one place. The project brief was to make a full stack website from scratch that looks like a Nintendo styled UI and actually works end to end. The reason behind it was to provide a clean organized way to track play history and organize a game library instead of random spreadsheets or notes. It is my biggest project since and I wanted to show I can handle both the front end and the back end parts together.
</p>

<img alt="Subsection" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Results-398bca?style=for-the-badge&logoColor=white"><br>
<p align="center">
The outcome was a working full stack web dashboard that feels like a real app. It pulls curated Nintendo game data from IGDB using a server proxy, saves a personal library into MongoDB, and manages per game goals that can be added, edited, checked off, or removed. The dashboard loads recent activity automatically based on last_played and shows a clean grid of the entire library. It also includes a friend activity section and a user settings page to round it out. While not a client delivery, it met my scope for functionality and design, and it proves I can integrate external APIs, database storage, and a responsive front end together in one project. The project can be viewed in full on my portfolio or GitHub when requested.
